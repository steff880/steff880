# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Stefan Yordanov
### Junior Full Stack Web Developer


I am a dedicated and innovative junior developer with over a year of practical experience in web development. I possess strong proficiency in a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, SASS, Express, Python, Flask, Django, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Materialize, Bootstrap, NPM, and Git.
Throughout my journey, I have completed more than 20 web projects independently and contributed to the success of over 5 team projects. My passion for technology and web development drives me to constantly expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest advancements in the field.
I am now seeking an entry-level position where I can apply my coding and problem-solving skills, along with my ability to quickly grasp new concepts. I am committed to continuous learning and strive to unleash my full potential in a dynamic work environment.
